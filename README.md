# Trojan

This is a trojan program in python with sophisticated tools like:
* reverse shell
* extracting system information
* clipboard capture
* screen and webcam recording (and live streaming)
* transferring files via FTP and emails.

P.S. More features are yet to come!


It is an extention of my [old trojan](https://github.com/ishaan-kapoor/CommandLineTrojan) which only worked on LAN.

All the senstitive information is stored in `Constants.json` along with other constants. Thus, a simple `git clone` won't work.

But the juciest part, the functions that perform all the above listed tasks, work properly and are separated in `Functions.py`.
Keep in mind that it has a ton of dependencies.

### This version is still under development.
